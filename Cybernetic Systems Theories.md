Cybernetics focuses on systems, control, and communication in animals and machines. It studies how systems self-regulate through feedback mechanisms and how they can be controlled and used for specific purposes. Cybernetic theories often apply to complex systems, where numerous elements interact in dynamic ways.


1. **[[Classical Cybernetics]]**: Deals with control and communication in animals and machines, focusing on feedback loops and regulation.
2. **[[Second-order Cybernetics]]**: Explores how observers (including the cyberneticians themselves) are part of the systems they study.
3. **[[Social Cybernetics]]**: Applies cybernetic principles to social systems and interactions.
4. **[[Biological Cybernetics]]**: Focuses on understanding control and communication processes in biological organisms.
