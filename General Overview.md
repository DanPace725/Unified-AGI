# A Unified Theory for Cultivating AI through Developmental Embodiment 

## Goal: Achieve artificial general intelligence through an embodied developmental approach leading to emergent cognition 

### Philosophical Foundations 
#philosophical_foundations
- [[Enactive Theories of Cognition]]
- [[Embodied Dynamism Theories]]
- [[Cybernetic Systems Theories]]
- [[Complexity Science]] 

### Biological Inspiration 
- [[Organismic Growth Trajectories]]
- [[Morphological Computation]]
- [[Neural Plasticity Processes]]

### Core Principles 
1. Co-development of computational and physical systems for tight integration 
2. Environments to drive interactive autonomy and open-ended learning 
3. [[Intrinsic Motivation]] for functional milestones of increasing complexity 
4. Fluid and recursive [[architecture reconfigurations]] over lifelong maturation 
5. Gradual progression in responsibility and context scope 

### System Architecture 
- Unified computational morphology spanning both informational and physical substrates - ([[Material Considerations]])
- Initial minimally viable seed system as starting point 
- Expandable modular library of components for compositional growth 
- Self-description language capturing structural changes over time

### Implementation Workflow 
1. Instantiate a minimally viable bootstrapping agent
2. Expose to approximated or actual task environments through embodiment
3. Agent incrementally builds/rewires own architecture guided by developmental priorities 
4. Expand context and autonomy as emergent functionality matures per measures
5. Repeat continuous ontogenetic growth process over long timecourse
