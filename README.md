# A Unified Theory for AI Development

## Description

This project aims to develop a novel approach to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) through an embodied developmental process. It integrates insights from various disciplines, including enactive and [[embodied cognition]], [[cybernetic systems theories]], and [[complexity science]], grounded in biological inspirations like [[organismic growth trajectories]], [[morphological computation]], and [[neural plasticity processes]].

## Objectives

- To create a comprehensive theoretical framework for AGI.
- Develop practical applications and models based on this framework.
- Foster interdisciplinary collaboration and knowledge sharing.

## Philosophical Foundations

- [[Enactive Theories of Cognition]]
- [[Embodied Dynamism Theories]]
- [[Cybernetic Systems Theories]]
- [[Complexity Science]]

## Biological Inspiration

- [[Organismic Growth Trajectories]]
- [[Morphological Computation]]
- [[Neural Plasticity Processes]]
