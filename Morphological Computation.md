This idea is based on the principle that the physical form and structure of an organism play a crucial role in how it processes information and interacts with its environment. In biological systems, a significant amount of computational work is offloaded to the physical body, reducing the cognitive load. Applying this to AI would mean designing systems where physical structure contributes to problem-solving and environmental interaction.
