This is a field of study that examines complex systems, which are systems with many interacting components that often exhibit unexpected or emergent behavior. Complexity science explores how relationships, behaviors, and the structure of systems evolve over time. It is applied across various disciplines, including biology, sociology, and economics, to understand complex phenomena.

1. **[[Chaos Theory]]**: Studies the behavior of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions, leading to the concept of the 'butterfly effect'.
2. **[[Network Theory]]**: Explores how networks of various elements (nodes and connections) can lead to complex behaviors and emergent properties.
3. **[[Adaptive Systems Theory]]**: Looks at how systems adapt and evolve in response to changing environments.
4. **[[Agent-based Modeling]]**: Involves simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous agents to assess their effects on the system as a whole.
