- **Concept**: Originating in the mid-20th century, Classical Cybernetics focuses on control and communication in animals and machines. It's concerned with how systems use feedback to regulate themselves and achieve goals.
- **Application**: In AI and robotics, Classical Cybernetics informs the design of systems that can self-regulate and adapt to changes through feedback loops. It's foundational in understanding automated control and system dynamics.
