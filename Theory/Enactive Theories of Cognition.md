These theories propose that cognition arises from dynamic interactions between an organism and its environment. Cognition is viewed as an embodied process, where knowledge and understanding emerge through practical engagement with the world, rather than being a representation in the brain.


1. **[[Autopoietic Enactivism]]**: Focuses on the self-producing and self-maintaining nature of living systems and how this relates to cognition.

2. **[[Sensorimotor Enactivism]]**: Emphasizes the importance of sensory and motor processes in shaping cognitive experiences.

3. **[[Radical Enactivism]]**: Argues that cognition extends beyond brain-based processes, deeply rooted in body-environment interactions.

4. **[[Interactive Enactivism]]**: Highlights the role of social interaction in the development of cognitive processes.
