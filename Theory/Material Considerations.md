1. **Material Requirements for Embodied AI Systems**:

    - **Flexibility and Durability**: Materials that can withstand various environmental conditions and physical stress, especially if the AI is to interact with real-world environments.
    - **Sensory Integration**: Materials that can integrate sensors or have sensory capabilities to enable interaction with the environment.
    - **Bio-compatibility**: If the system is to interface with biological entities or environments, materials should be non-toxic and compatible with biological systems.
2. **Integrated Computational Materials**:

    - **Smart Materials**: Materials that can change properties in response to stimuli (like temperature, light, or electric fields), which could be useful for adaptive and responsive AI systems.
    - **Conductive Polymers**: For electrical integration and signaling within the system.
    - **Piezoelectric Materials**: Useful for converting mechanical energy into electrical energy and vice versa, allowing the system to interact with its environment more dynamically.
3. **Modularity and Scalability**:

    - **Modular Components**: Materials and components that can be easily added, removed, or reconfigured as the AI system grows and evolves.
    - **Scalable Design**: Materials should support scalability, allowing the system to expand its capabilities without major overhauls.
4. **Energy Efficiency**:

    - **Energy-efficient Materials**: To ensure sustainability, especially if the system is meant for long-term autonomous operation.
5. **Integration with Computational Substrates**:

    - **Hybrid Systems**: Materials that can integrate seamlessly with computational hardware and software, allowing for efficient communication and control between the physical and computational aspects of the AI.
6. **Fabrication and Assembly Techniques**:
  
    - **3D Printing and Nanotechnology**: Advanced fabrication techniques like 3D printing or nanotechnology could be pivotal in creating complex structures needed for your system.
