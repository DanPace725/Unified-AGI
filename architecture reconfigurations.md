- This concept involves the ability of the AI system to change and reconfigure its own architecture dynamically. Unlike traditional AI systems with fixed architectures, this approach allows for a fluid and evolving structure.
- Architecture reconfiguration could involve changing neural network connections, adapting data processing pathways, or modifying how different modules of the AI interact. The system could reconfigure itself based on experiences, learning outcomes, or changes in its environment.
- This [[dynamic reconfiguration]] is akin to the developmental changes seen in biological organisms, where the structure and function of systems (like the brain) evolve over time. In AI, this would allow for continuous adaptation and growth, enabling the system to become more complex and capable over its lifetime.
