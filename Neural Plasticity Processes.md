Neural plasticity is the ability of the brain to change and adapt as a result of experience. This includes the formation of new neural connections and the strengthening or weakening of existing ones. In AI, this concept could inspire the development of adaptable, learning neural networks that change and evolve based on interactions and experiences, similar to how a biological brain learns and adapts.
