- In traditional AI systems, motivation often comes from external rewards or objectives defined by the programmer (e.g., maximizing a score in a game). In contrast, intrinsic motivation refers to a system's internal drive to explore, learn, and adapt based on its inherent interests or curiosities, without the need for external rewards.
- In this context, intrinsic motivation could be implemented as algorithms or mechanisms that enable the AI to autonomously seek out new experiences, challenges, or information. This mirrors how humans and animals are driven by [[Curiosity]] and the intrinsic desire to understand their environment and improve their skills.
- The goal is to create an AI system that is self-driven to achieve functional milestones, constantly seeking to expand its capabilities, knowledge, and understanding through its interactions with the world.
